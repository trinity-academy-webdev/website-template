# Week 2: HTML Basics
In this week you will work with HTML. Try completing the following tasks (feel free to get creative and add any personalisation as you go!)

    - [ ] Change the header of the description section.
    - [ ] Change the description text to include a brief description of what you want.
          
3. Adding an image
    - [ ] Using the `<img>` tag choose one of the images from the Charity Images folder to display below the description.
    - [ ] **Extension 1:** Let's make the image appear in the centre of the page instead. You'll need to add some code to the `styles.css` file.

        (Hint 1) Use the image's `id` attribute to reference it in `styles.css`

        (Hint 2) Try setting the `margin` style. See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp) for a tutorial.

# Week 3: Gallery Page and CSS Styling

In this session, youâ€™ll learn some basic CSS styling. This week you will work in the gallery page. Have a go at the following tasks: 

1. Changing the background
    - [ ] In the CSS file, find the `hero-section` selector, and do the following:
        - [ ] Change the `background-color` style, which decides the color of the background
        - [ ] background-image. Here we pass in a linear-gradient function which creates a gradient on the background.
                Here you can change the color of the gradient, as well as its direction. Find out more about gradients <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp">here</a>:
2. Centre the gallery element

1. Add the listed information to the past events table:

     - [ ] Create a row for every event entry
     - [ ] Add the appropriate entry to the specific columns
     - [ ] Format the table to what you want! (You can change the dimensions of the table, or the colour of the lines! If you want to add pictures too you can!)
2. Create a future events table and come up with innovative charity events to put in it!
   - [ ] Create a new table in the right area, with these headers:
      - [ ] Events

      - [ ] Target Money Raised
